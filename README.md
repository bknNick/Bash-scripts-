# Bash-scripts-
This repository contains bash scripts.
They are created in order to make the system administration more easyer and efficient. 
If you decide to use some of them on your local system or on production system 
I recomment to check the code just to make shure that no harmful consequences will follow after executing the script/s.
If you have ideas on how to make them better I would love to share with me your thouts on the matter :)
